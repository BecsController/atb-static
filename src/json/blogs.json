In this Symposium, post-docs and graduate students gather in one place to talk about their personal research and try to find a way in which they can collaborate with other researchers.\n\n There is a common theme to each symposium and in this occasion it focused on commercializing research in order to generate a profit from potential projects and also to generate jobs. Nowadays, graduating with a university degree does not ensure that one will find a position in the job market. There may not even be such a market, hence the importance of planning ahead and creating as many possibilities as one can in order to have a job. It would seem that universities no longer focus on just graduating students but also have an interest in their alumni becoming entrepreneurs, not only for their own benefit but also for the benefit of the country’s economy.\n\nTo illustrate this concept, we see an infinite recurring cycle represented by an apple that contains the process of the seeds growing into a mature tree that bears the fruit that will be taken to market. Thus creating sustainable jobs and investments into the field..\n\nThis is a blog by the way........coool",
