      "This issue, Interface 21, was a milestone since the magazine went through a complete redesign and I was lucky enough to be called upon to work on the cover. I had to hunt down an old milk bottle from a thrift shop so I could photograph it for both the cover and the article. Fortunately it was only a 10 minute walk down the street and even had the chance to choose which bottle I wanted.",
      "The idea was to have a vintage look and the combination of hand drawn fonts and a blackboard texture for the background was ideal for this purpose. The dark background also helped to make the milk bottle and the title to stand out."

The repetition of these elements can then devise organized structures, by which, the concept of having advanced materials or nanotechnology has been achieved."

There is a common theme to each symposium and in this occasion it focused on commercializing research in order to generate a profit from potential projects and also to generate jobs. Nowadays, graduating with a university degree does not ensure that one will find a position in the job market.",
      "There may not even be such a market, hence the importance of planning ahead and creating as many possibilities as one can in order to have a job. It would seem that universities no longer focus on just graduating students but also have an interest in their alumni becoming entrepreneurs, not only for their own benefit but also for the benefit of the country’s economy. To illustrate this concept, we see an infinite recurring cycle represented by an apple that contains the process of the seeds growing into a mature tree that bears the fruit that will be taken to market. Thus creating sustainable jobs and investments into the field."

How does one find the best way to transmit the importance of their work and the way it affects us in our every day lives without getting lost in all the mumble jumble?
